NBA_Predictions
===============

Code for webscraping/genetic algorithm to predict NBA outcomes.


Warning!! Unorganized R code!!  Poorly commented!

That having been said...

This is a script that involves several things to predict the outcome of NBA games.

1) Webscrape team statistics, player statistics, schedule statistics, player health...

2) Run a genetic algorithm to predict:
  
  a. Declare genetic functions:
    i. Initialize population of solutions.
    ii. Create offspring from two parents.
    iii. Mutate offspring.
    iv. Evaluate fitness of an individual solution.
    v. Prediction function
    
  b. Run Genetic Algorithm
  
3) Output results in .xls file.


**Warning**  The current set up takes about 4 hours to run. (I run it at 3am daily).
